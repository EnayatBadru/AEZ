# AEZ Bank
The AEZ Banking System Project is a school project being developed by a team of three. The system aims to provide internet banking functionalities to its users with features like sending money, tagging frequent accounts as friends, managing bank information, trading money from one currency to another, setting the time to go to an ATM to withdraw some money, and other basic internet banking functionalities.

## Technologies Used
The project is being developed using the following technologies:

* Entity Framework
* PostgreSQL
* ASP.NET Core
* C#
* SendGrid

## Features

### Sending Money
The system will allow users to send money to other users within the same bank. The system will ask for the recipient's account details and the amount to be transferred. Once the transfer is initiated, the system will deduct the amount from the sender's account and add it to the recipient's account.

### Tagging Frequent Accounts as Friends
Users can tag their frequent account holders as friends. This will allow the system to prioritize their transactions with friends, making the process faster and smoother.

### Managing Bank Information
Users can manage their bank information like account details, passwords, and other sensitive information. They can also update their information whenever necessary.

### Trading Money from One Currency to Another
Users can trade money from one currency to another with the system's help. This feature will help users who frequently make international transactions.

### Setting Time to Go to an ATM to Withdraw Some Money
Users can set the time to go to an ATM to withdraw some money. The system will remind the user when the time comes, ensuring that they don't forget.
